<h2>Revised by Dave Lyons & Matt Deatherage (March 1990)
<br />Written by Matt Deatherage & Dan Strnad (November 1988)</h2>

<p>This Technical Note describes how to identify ProDOS devices and their characteristics given the ProDOS unit number.  This scheme should only be used under ProDOS 8.</p>

<p><em>Changes since January 1990:</em> Modified AppleTalk call code for compatibility with ProDOS 8 versions earlier than 1.5 and network-booted version 1.4.</p>

<hr>

<p>There are various reasons why an application would want to identify ProDOS devices.  Although ProDOS itself takes great pains to treat all devices equally, it has internal drivers for two types of devices: Disk II drives and the /RAM drive provided on 128K or greater machines.  Because all devices really are not equal (i.e., some cannot format while others are read-only, etc.), a developer may need to know how to identify a ProDOS device.</p>

<p>Although the question of how much identification is subjective for each  developer, ProDOS 8 offers a fair level of identification; the only devices  which cannot be conclusively identified are those devices with RAM-based  drivers, and they could be anything.  The vast majority of ProDOS devices can  be identified, however, so you could prompt the user to insert a disk in  UniDisk 3.5 #2, instead of Slot 2, Drive 2, which could be confusing if the  user has a IIc or IIGS.</p>

<p>Note that for the majority of applications, this level of identification is  unnecessary.  Most applications simply prompt the user to insert a disk by its  name, and the user can place it in any drive which is capable of working with  the media of the disk.  You should avoid requiring a certain disk to be in a  specific drive since doing so defeats much of the device-independence which  gives ProDOS 8 its strength.</p>

<p>When you do need to identify a device (i.e., if you need to format media in  a Disk II or /RAM device), however, the process is fairly straightforward.   This process consists of a series of tests, any one of which could end with a  conclusive device identification.  It is not possible to look at a single ID  byte to determine a particular device type.  You may determine rather quickly  that a device is a SmartPort device, or you may go all the way through the  procedure to identify a third-party network device.  For those developers who  absolutely must identify devices, DTS presents the following discussion.</p>


<h2>Isn't There Some Kind of "ID Nibble?"</h2>

<p>ProDOS 8 does not support an "ID nibble."  Section 5.2.4 of the ProDOS 8  Technical Reference Manual states that the low nibble of each unit number in  the device list "is a device identification:  0 = Disk II, 4 = Profile,  $F = /RAM."</p>

<p>When ProDOS 8 finds a "smart" ProDOS block device while doing its search of the slots and ports, it copies the high nibble of $CnFE (where n is the slot number) into the low nibble of the unit number in the global page.  The low nibble then has the following definition:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Bit 3:</dt><dd>Medium is removable</dd>
<dt>Bit 2:</dt><dd>Device is interruptible</dd>
<dt>Bit 1-0:</dt><dd>Number of volumes on the device (minus one)</dd>
</dl>

<p>As you can see, it is quite easy for the second definition to produce one of 
the original values (e.g., 0, 4, or $F) in the same nibble for completely 
different reasons.  You should ignore the low nibble in the unit number in the 
global page when identifying devices since the first definition is 
insufficient to uniquely identify devices and the second definition contains 
no information to specifically identify devices.  Once you do identify a 
ProDOS block device, however, you may look at $CnFE to obtain the information 
in the second definition above, as well as information on reading, writing, 
formatting, and status availability.</p>

<p>When identifying ProDOS devices, start with a list of unit numbers for all 
currently installed disk devices.  As you progress through the identification 
process, you identify some devices immediately, while others must wait until 
the end of the process for identification.</p>


<h2>Starting with the Unit Number</h2>

<p>ProDOS unit numbers (unit_number) are bytes where the bits are arranged
in the pattern DSSS0000, where D = 0 for drive one and D = 1 for drive
two, SSS is a three-bit integer with values from one through seven
indicating the device slot number (zero is not a valid slot number), and
the low nibble is ignored.</p>

<p>To obtain a list of the unit numbers for all currently installed ProDOS disk 
devices, you can perform a ProDOS MLI ON_LINE call with a unit number of $00.  
This call returns a unit number and a volume name for every device in the 
device list.  ProDOS stores the length of the volume name in the low nibble of 
the unit number which ON_LINE returns; if an error occurs, the low nibble 
contains $0 and the byte immediately following the unit number contains an 
error code.  For more information on the ON_LINE call, see section 4.4.6 of 
the ProDOS 8 Technical Reference Manual.  A more detailed discussion of the 
error codes follows later in this Note.</p>

<p>To identify the devices in the device list, you need to know in which
physical slot the hardware resides, so you can look at the slot I/O ROM
space and check the device's identification bytes.  Note that the
slot-number portion of the unit number does not always represent the
physical slot of the device, rather, it sometimes represents the logical
slot where you can find the address of the device's driver entry point in
the ProDOS global page.  For example, if a SmartPort device interface in
slot 5 has more than two connected devices, the third and fourth devices
are mapped to slot 2; this mapping gives these two devices unit numbers of
$20 and $A0 respectively, but the device's driver entry point is still in
the $C5xx address space.</p>

<p><a href="/docs/technote/20/">ProDOS 8 Technical Note #20</a>, Mirrored
Devices and SmartPort, discusses this kind of mapping in detail.  It also
presents a code example which gives you the correct device-driver entry
point (from the global page) given the unit number as input.  Here is the
code example from that Note for your benefit.  It assumes the unit_number
is in the accumulator.</p>

<pre>

devcnt      equ    $BF31
devlst      equ    $BF32
devadr      equ    $BF10
devget      sta    unitno      ; store for later compare instruction
            ldx    devcnt      ; get count-1 from $BF31
devloop     lda    devlst,x    ; get entry in list
            and    #$F0        ; mask off low nibble
devcomp     cmp    unitno      ; compare to the unit_number we filled in
            beq    goodnum     ;
            dex
            bpl    devloop     ; loop again if still less than $80
            bmi    badunitno   ; error: bad unit number
goodnum     lda    unitno      ; get good copy of unit_number
            lsr    a           ; divide it by 8
            lsr    a           ; (not sixteen because devadr entries are
            lsr    a           ; two bytes wide)
            tax
            lda    devadr,x    ; low byte of device driver address
            sta    addr
            lda    devadr+1,x  ; high byte of device driver address
            sta    addr+1
            rts
addr        dw     0           ; address will be filled in here by goodnum
unitno      dfb    0           ; unit number storage

</pre>

<blockquote><em>Warning:</em> Attempting to construct the device-driver
entry point from the unit number is very dangerous.  Always use the
technique presented above.</blockquote>


<h2>Network Volumes</h2>

<p>AppleTalk volumes present a special problem to some developers since they 
appear as "phantom devices," or devices which do not always have a device 
driver installed in the ProDOS global page.  Fortunately, the ProDOS Filing 
Interface (PFI) to AppleTalk provides a way to identify network volumes 
through an MLI call.  The ProDOS Filing Interface call FIListSessions is used 
to retrieve a list of the current sessions being maintained through PFI and 
any volumes mounted for those sessions.</p>

<p>In the following example, note the check for ProDOS 8 version 1.5 or higher, 
and the simulation of a bad command error under older versions (the $42 call 
under ProDOS 8 version 1.4 always crashes if ProDOS was launched from a local 
disk):</p>

<pre>

Network     LDA    #$04        ;require at least ProDOS 8 1.4
            CMP    $BFFF       ;KVERSION (ProDOS 8 version)
            BEQ    MoreNetwork ;have to check further
            LDA    #$01        ;simulate bad command error
            BCS    ERROR       ;if 3 or less, no possibility of network
            BCC    NetCall     ;otherwise, try the network call

MoreNetwork LDA    $BF02       ;high byte of the MLI entry point
            AND    #$F0        ;strip off the low nibble
            CMP    #$C0        ;is the entry into the $Cn00 space?
            BEQ    NetCall     ;yes, so try AppleTalk
            LDA    #$01
            SEC
            BCS    ERROR       ;simulate bad command error

NetCall     JSR    $BF00        ;ProDOS MLI
            DFB    $42          ;AppleTalk command number
            DW     ParamAddr    ;Address of Parameter Table
            BCS    ERROR        ;error occurred

ParamAddr   DFB    $00          ;Async Flag (0 means synchronous only)
                                ;note there is no parameter count
            DFB    $2F          ;command for FIListSessions
            DW     $0000        ;AppleTalk Result Code returned here
            DW     BufLength    ;length of the buffer supplied
            DW     BufPointer   ;low word of pointer to buffer
            DW     $0000        ;high word of pointer to buffer
                                ;(THIS WILL NOT BE ZERO IF THE BUFFER IS
                                ;NOT IN BANK ZERO!)
            DFB    $00          ;Number of entries returned here

</pre>

<p>If the FIListSessions call fails with a bad command error ($01), then 
AppleShare is not installed; therefore, there are no networks volumes mounted.  
If there is a network error, the accumulator contains $88 (Network Error), and 
the result code in the parameter block contains the specific error code.  The 
list of current sessions is placed into the buffer (at the address BufPointer 
in the example above), but if the buffer is not large enough to hold the list, 
it retains the maximum number of current sessions possible and returns an 
error with a result code of $0A0B (Buffer Too Small).  The buffer format is as 
follows:</p>

<pre>

SesnRef     DFB    $00          ;Sessions Reference number (result)
UnitNum     DFB    $00          ;Unit Number (result)
VolName     DS     28           ;28 byte space for Volume Name
                                ;(starts with a length byte)
VolumeID    DW    $0000         ;Volume ID (result)

</pre>

<p>This list is repeated for every volume mounted for each session (the
number is placed into the last byte of the parameter list you passed to
the ProDOS MLI).  For example, if there are two volumes mounted for
session one, then session one is listed two times.  The UnitNum field
contains the slot and drive number in unit-number format, and note that
bit zero of this byte is set if the volume is a user volume (i.e., it
contains a special "users" folder).  This distinction is unimportant for
identifying a ProDOS device as a network pseudo-device, but it is
necessary for applications which need to know the location of the user
volume.  Note that if you mount two servers or more with each having its
own user volume, the user volume found first in the list (scanned top to
bottom) returned by FIListSessions specifies the user volume that an
application should use.  See the AppleShare Programmer's Guide for the
Apple IIGS for more information on programming for network volumes.</p>

<p>If you keep a list of all unit numbers returned by the ON_LINE call and mark 
each one "identified" as you identify it, keep in mind that the unit numbers 
returned by FIListSessions and ON_LINE have different low nibbles which should 
be masked off before you make any comparisons.</p>

<blockquote><em>Note:</em> You should mark the network volumes as
identified and not try to identify them further with the following
methods.</blockquote>


<h2>What Slot is it Really In?</h2>

<p>Once you have the address of the device driver's entry point and know
that the device is not a network pseudo-device, you can determine in what
physical slot the device resides.  If the high byte of the device driver's
entry point is of the form $Cn, then n is the physical slot number of the
device.  A SmartPort device mirrored to slot 2 has a device driver address
of $C5xx, giving 5 as the physical slot number.</p>

<p>If the high byte of the device driver entry point is not of the form 
$Cn, then there are three other possibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>The device is a Disk II with driver code inside ProDOS.</li>

<li>The device is either /RAM with driver code inside ProDOS or a
third-party auxiliary-slot RAM disk device with driver code installed
somewhere in memory.</p>

<li>The device is not a RAM disk but has a RAM-based device driver, like a
third-party network device.</li>
</ul>

<p>Auxiliary-slot RAM disks are identified by convention.  Any device in
slot 3, drive 2 (unit number $B0) is assumed to be an auxiliary-slot RAM
disk since ProDOS 8 does not recognize any card which is not an 80-column
card in slot 3 (see <a href="/docs/technote/15/">ProDOS 8 Technical Note
#15</a>, How ProDOS 8 Treats Slot 3).  There is a chance that some other
kind of device could be installed with unit number $B0, but it is not
likely.</p>

<p>To identify various kinds of auxiliary-slot RAM disks, you must obtain
the unit number from the ProDOS global page.  The list of unit numbers
starts at $BF32 (DEVLST) and is preceded by the number of unit numbers
minus one (DEVCNT, at $BF31).  You should search through this list until
you find a unit number in the form $Bx; if the unit number is $B3, $B7,
$BB, or $BF, you can assume the device to be an auxiliary-slot RAM disk
which uses the auxiliary 64K bank of memory present in a 128K Apple IIe or
IIc, or a IIGS.  If the unit number is one of the four listed above, you
must remove this device to safely access memory in the auxiliary 64K bank,
but if the unit number is not one of the four listed above, you can assume
the device to be an auxiliary-slot RAM disk which does not use the normal
bank of auxiliary memory.  (Some third-party auxiliary-slot cards contain
more than one 64K auxiliary bank; the normal use of this memory is as a
RAM disk.  If the RAM-based driver for this kind of card does not use the
normal auxiliary 64K bank for storage, it should have a unit number other
than one of the four listed above.)  If the unit number is not one of the
four listed above, you may safely access the auxiliary bank of memory
without first removing this device.</p>

<p>Section 5.2.2.3 of the ProDOS 8 Technical Reference Manual contains a
routine which disconnects the appropriate RAM disk devices in slot 3,
drive 2, without removing those drivers which do not use that bank, to
allow use of the auxiliary 64K bank.</p>

<blockquote><em>Note:</em> Previous information from Apple indicated that
/RAM could be distinguished from third-party RAM disks by a driver address
of $FF00.  Although the address has not changed, some third-party drivers
may have addresses of $FF00 as well, although this is not supported.  /RAM
always has a driver address of $FF00 and unit number $BF, although any
third-party RAM disk could install itself with similar attributes.</blockquote>

<p>For Disk II devices, the three-bit slot number portion of the unit_number is 
always the physical slot number.  Disk II devices can never be mirrored to 
another slot (the Disk II driver does not support it); therefore, it is in the 
physical slot represented in the unit number which ProDOS assigns when it 
boots.</p>

<p>If the high byte of the device driver's entry point is not of the form $Cn, 
then you should assume that the slot number is the value SSS in the unit 
number (this is equivalent to assuming the device is a Disk II) for the next 
step, which is checking the I/O space for identification bytes.</p>


<h2>What to Do With the Slot Number</h2>

<p>Once you have the slot number, you can look at the slot I/O ROM space to 
determine the kind of device it is.  As described in the ProDOS 8 Technical 
Reference Manual, ProDOS looks for the following ID bytes in ROM to determine 
if a ProDOS device is in a slot:</p>

<pre>

    $Cn01 = $20
    $Cn03 = $00
    $Cn05 = $03

</pre>

<p>If you use the slot number, n, you obtained above, and the three values
listed above are not present, then the device has a RAM-based driver and
cannot further be identified.</p>

<p>If the three values previously discussed are present, then examination of 
$CnFF gives more information.  If $CnFF = $00, the device is a Disk II.  If 
$CnFF is any value other than $00 or $FF ($FF signifies a 13-sector Disk II, 
which ProDOS does not support), the device is a ProDOS block device.</p>

<p>For ProDOS block devices, the byte at $CnFE contains several flags which 
further identify the device; these flags are discussed in section 6.3.1 of the 
ProDOS 8 Technical Reference Manual.</p>


<h2>SmartPort Devices</h2>

<p>Many of Apple's ProDOS block devices follow the SmartPort firmware
interface.  Through SmartPort, you can further identify devices.  
Existing SmartPort devices include SCSI hard disks, 3.5" disk drives and
CD-ROM drives, with many more possible device types.</p>

<p>If $Cn07 = $00, then the device is a SmartPort device, and you can then
make a SmartPort call to get more information about the device, including
a device type and subtype.  The SmartPort entry point is three bytes
beyond the ProDOS block device entry point, which you already determined.  
The method for making SmartPort calls is outlined in the Apple IIc
Technical Reference Manual, Second Edition and the Apple IIGS Firmware
Reference.</p>

<p>The most useful SmartPort call to make for device identification is the
STATUS call with statcode = 3 for Return Device Information Block (DIB).  
This call returns the ASCII name of the device, a device type and subtype,
as well as the size of the device.  Some SmartPort device types and
subtypes are listed in the referenced manuals, with a more complete list
located in the Apple IIGS Firmware Reference.  A list containing SmartPort
device types only is provided in <a href="/docs/technote/smartport/04/">SmartPort 
Technical Note #4</a>, SmartPort Device Types.</p>



<h2>RAM-Based Drivers</h2>

<p>One fork of the identification tree comes to an end at this point.  If the 
high byte of the device driver entry point was not $Cn and the device was not 
/RAM, you assumed it was a Disk II and used the slot number portion of the 
unit number to examine the slot ROM space.  If the ROM space for that slot 
number does not match the three ProDOS block device ID bytes, it cannot be a 
Disk II.  Having ruled out other possibilities, it must be a device installed 
after ProDOS finished building its device table.  Perhaps it is a third-party 
RAM disk driver or maybe a driver for an older card which does not match the 
ProDOS block device ID bytes.</p>

<p>Whatever the function of the driver, you can identify it no further.  
It quite literally could be any kind of device at all, and with neither
slot ROM space to identify nor a standard location to compare the device
driver entry point against, the best you can do is consider it a "generic
device" and go on.</p>


<h2>But Is It Connected and Can I Read From It?</h2>

<p>Just because a ProDOS device is in the table does not mean it is ready to be 
used.  There is always the possibility that the drive has no media in it.  
Back in the beginning, you made an ON_LINE call with a unit number of $00.  If 
the volume name of a disk in that device could not be read, or another error 
occurred, ProDOS 8 would return the error code in the ON_LINE buffer 
immediately following the unit number.  Those errors possible include:</p>

<ul>
<li>$27: I/O error</li>
<li>$28: No Device Connected</li>
<li>$2B: Write Protected</li>
<li>$2F: Device off-line</li>
<li>$45: Volume directory not found</li>
<li>$52: Not a ProDOS disk</li>
<li>$55: Volume Control Block full</li>
<li>$56: Bad buffer address</li>
<li>$57: Duplicate volume on-line</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that error $2F is not listed in the ProDOS 8 Technical Reference 
Manual.</p>

<p>By convention, you interpret I/O error to mean the disk in the drive is
either damaged or blank (not formatted).  You interpret Device off-line to
mean that there is no disk in the drive.  You interpret No Device
Connected to mean the drive really does not exist (for example, asking for
status on a second Disk II when only one is connected).</p>

<p>If no error occurred for a unit number in the ON_LINE call (the low
nibble of the unit number is not zero), the volume name of the disk in the
drive follows the unit number.</p>


<h2>Things To Avoid</h2>

<p>The ProDOS device-level STATUS call generally returns the number of
blocks on a device.  Applications should not try to identify 3.5" drives
by doing a ProDOS or SmartPort STATUS call and comparing the number of
blocks to 800 or 1,600.  The correct way to identify a 3.5" drive is by
the Type field in a SmartPort STATUS call.</p>

<p>Don't assume the characteristics of a device just because it is in a certain 
slot.  For example, be prepared to deal with 5.25" disk drives in slots other 
than 6.  Don't assume that slot 6 is associated with block devices at all --
there could be a printer card installed.</p>

<p>Avoid reinstalling /RAM when your application finds it removed.  If you
remove /RAM, you should reinstall it when you're done with the extra
memory; however, if your application finds /RAM already gone, you do not
have the right to just reinstall it.  A driver of some kind may be
installed in auxiliary memory, and arbitrary reinstallation of /RAM could
bring the system down.</p>
