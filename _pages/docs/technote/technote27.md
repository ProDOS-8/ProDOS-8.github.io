<h2>Written by Matt Deatherage (March 1990)</h2>

<p>This Technical Note discusses considerations for "hybrid" applications,
which use Apple IIGS-specific features from ProDOS 8.</p>

<hr>


<h2>Why Use Hybrid Features?</h2>

<p>There are many reasons not to write hybrid applications.  If your target 
machine is the Apple IIGS, it's pretty silly to write a ProDOS 8-based 
application.  You are limited to the slower I/O model of ProDOS 8, you cannot 
access foreign file systems or large CD-ROM volumes, you cannot reliably 
access the toolbox (patches to the toolbox are only loaded when GS/OS is 
booted, which forces you to require GS/OS to be booted), and you cannot work 
with desk accessories that do disk access (CDAs cannot reliably "save and 
restore" an area of bank zero to use for ProDOS 8 disk access because they 
don't know if an interrupt handling routine is located there).</p>

<p>However, applications targeted for all Apple II computers may
reasonably wish to take advantage of IIGS features.  For example, a word
processor or telecommunications program may want to use extra IIGS memory.  
This Note is your spiritual guide to such features.</p>


<h2>Memory Management</h2>

<p>Applications wishing to use extended (beyond the lower 128K) memory on the 
IIGS must, like all IIGS applications, get it from the Memory Manager.  This 
is not a consideration for non-hybrid applications for two reasons.  First, 
when GS/OS launches a ProDOS 8 program, it reserves all of the lower 128K 
memory for ProDOS 8, so no other component (tool, desk accessory, INIT) can 
accidentally use that memory.  (In fact, if some of the memory is not 
available, GS/OS refuses to launch ProDOS 8 at all.)  Second, when ProDOS 8 is 
directly booted, none of the memory is allocated since these other components, 
which might be using the Memory Manager, aren't loaded either.</p>

<p>If your ProDOS 8 application was launched by GS/OS, all of the managed lower 
128K has already been allocated for you by GS/OS.  If you call MMStartUp, the 
user ID returned is one belonging to GS/OS.  In such cases, the auxiliary 
field of the user ID is already being used by GS/OS and must not be altered by 
your application.  You also must not call any Memory Manager routine which 
works on all handles of a given user ID, such as DisposeAll or HUnlockAll.  
You must manage all handles individually and not by user ID.  You may, if you 
wish, call GetNewID to get a new user ID for use in a user ID-based memory 
management system.  The ID should be of type $1000 (application).</p>

<p>You can tell whether your application was launched by GS/OS by checking 
OS_BOOT, the byte value at $E100BD.  OS_BOOT is $00 when the boot OS was 
ProDOS 8, indicating that your application was not loaded by GS/OS.  If this 
is the case and you want to use extended IIGS memory, you should call GetNewID 
to obtain a new application ID then use NewHandle to allocate four handles to 
hold the memory normally reserved for ProDOS 8 by GS/OS.  You should obtain 
memory at $00/0800 (size $B800), $01/0800 (size $B800), $E0/2000 (size $4000) 
and $E1/2000 (size $8000).  You may then use MMStartUp to register yourself 
with the Memory Manager; MMStartUp fails if it's being called from an 
unallocated memory block, so you must allocate the memory your application 
occupies first.</p>
