#### [Disk II card connected to an SVD (Semi Virtual Diskette) drive emulator](http://thesvd.com/) Compatibility


* [The SVD card](http://thesvd.com/apple.php) is not 100% compatible with the Disk ][.
* The new ProDOS 2.5 boot loader steps the head through 1/4 tracks and 1/2 tracks, and so requires 5.25 drives with 1/4 track compatibility.
* [The SVD page for Apple II](http://thesvd.com/apple.php) states that [the SVD drive](http://thesvd.com/apple.php) is currently incompatible with half-track seeks.
* ProDOS 2.5.x will boot using older boot blocks, so if you copy ProDOS 2.4 boot blocks to a ProDOS 2.5.x disk it _may_ boot on SVD.
