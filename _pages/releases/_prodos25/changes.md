## Changes

* Lowercase volume support.
* Lowercase filenames match what GS/OS and the Finder use.<br />_If an application does not support lowercase filenames they will read the directory and see uppercase filenames._<br />_There is no case sensitivity in the filenames._
* Can pass relative path arguments to commands, such as:

{% highlight basic %}

CAT ..
PREFIX ../..
{% endhighlight %}

* Year has been expanded from 7-bits _(127 years)_ to 10-bits _(1,024 years)_ to allow date support until the year 2924.<br />_There is still a year 2040 problem where the 24-bit timer on the Apple IIgs will wrap around to 1900._
